      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We take data protection and privacy very seriously at Beem. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your Personal Data. Below is an overview of the key points of our privacy policy and practices:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not re-sell Personal Data.</li>
        <li>We take care to encrypt Private Sensitive Personal Data (defined below) like journal entries or reflections (only you have access to that content).</li>
        <li>​​Any App Analytics Data that we do collect &ndash; in the spirit of improving or personalizing the product, messaging, and content &ndash; is studied only at an aggregate level across the Beem community (e.g., which sessions are most popular), unless necessary for specific customer support or de-bugging.</li>
        <li>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide users&rsquo; Personal Data to any 3rd party data brokers.</li>
        <li>As is customary for web-based services, we partner with Service Providers (e.g., payment processors, database providers) to support our App and Analytics Partners to study how best to improve our App (e.g., which sessions are most popular). Personal Data shared with these providers is encrypted and protected both in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li>We do not share any Private Sensitive Personal Data with any Advertising Partners.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect or solicit the data of individuals under the age of 13 without obtaining COPPA-compliant consent from a parent or guardian, and we do not knowingly share information about individuals under the age of 13 with Advertising Partners.</li>
        <li>You may, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, delete your full account and all data associated with it at any point.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At any time you may opt out of cookies and other tracking or exercise your other rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. Please read on to the Full Privacy Policy for more details.</p>
      <p>Your use of our Services is subject to our&nbsp;Terms of Service, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service. If we make any changes to the way we collect or use your Personal Data we will send you a notice of those changes in accordance with the section titled&nbsp;<u>&ldquo;Changes to this Privacy Policy&rdquo;</u>&nbsp;below.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>By creating an account, accessing our Services, or opting into communications from us, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined below, and you consent that we will collect, use and share your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong>&nbsp;If you are under 18, please be sure to read this Privacy Policy with a parent or guardian.</p>

      <p>We disclose your Personal Data to the categories of service providers and other parties listed in this section. For more information, please refer to the state-specific sections below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;These parties help us provide the Services or perform business functions on our behalf. They include:

            <li>Hosting, technology, and communication providers.</li>
            <li>Support and customer service vendors.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Partners.&nbsp;</strong>These parties provide analytics on web traffic or usage of the Services. They include:
          <ul>
            <li>Companies that track how users interact with the Services.</li>
            <li>Companies that track how users found or were referred to the Services.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Parties You Authorize, Access or Authenticate</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Third parties you access through the services.</li>
            <li>Other users.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Legal Obligations</strong></p>
      <p>We may share any Personal Data that we collect with third parties in conjunction with any of the activities set forth under &ldquo;Meeting Legal Requirements and Enforcing Legal Terms&rdquo; in the&nbsp;<u>&ldquo;Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting Personal Data&rdquo;</u>&nbsp;section above.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
      <p>All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before (most likely via email) your information becomes subject to different privacy or security policies and practices.</p>
      <p><strong>Data that is Not Personal Data</strong></p>
      <p>We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not share such data in a manner that could identify you. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>4. Data Security and Retention</strong></p>
      <p>We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational&nbsp; and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data.&nbsp;<strong>We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data, and we further encrypt Private Sensitive Personal Data in a manner designed to ensure only you and those you choose to share it with can view it in unencrypted form.&nbsp;</strong>We also ask for your help to protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.</p>
      <p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal or business obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may also retain information in an anonymous, de-identified, aggregated form such that information would not identify you personally.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Personal Data of Children</strong></p>
      <p>The Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;COPPA&rdquo;) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) requires that data controllers obtain consent from the holders of parental responsibility over children who are under 16 years of age before such controllers knowingly collect and process Personal Data from such children.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 (if such child is located in the United States) or under 16 (if such child is located in the European Union or United Kingdom) (in each case, a &ldquo;Child under the Age of Consent&rdquo;) without obtaining verifiable consent from that child&rsquo;s parent or guardian (&ldquo;Parental Consent&rdquo;), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (&ldquo;Required Information&rdquo;). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, please do not attempt to send any Personal Data about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If you believe that a Child under the Age of Consent has provided us with Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at&nbsp;<u>info@beem.earth</u>. We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent than is reasonably necessary for that participation, and we do not retain Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.</p>
      <p>If you are a parent or guardian of a user of our Services who is a Child under the Age of Consent, you may contact us at any time to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Data from such user, (b) we assist you in deleting any Personal Data already collected from such user (although note that we may retain information in an anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated form where that information would not identify such user personally), or (c) we stop disclosing Personal Data collected from such user to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Personal Data collected from such user in connection with the Services.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, your parent or guardian can view all information within or associated with your Beem account, including, without limitation, all categories of Personal Data as outlined above, by contacting us at&nbsp;<u>info@beem.earth</u>.</p>
      <p>For clarity, we do not knowingly collect, maintain, use or share any Personal Data of any users that are a Child under the Age of Consent beyond that needed for authorized purposes, or as authorized by the user or his/her parent or legal guardian. In no instance do we sell any Personal Data of users that are a Child under the Age of Consent. We also do not knowingly use or disclose Personal Data of any users under the Age of Consent for behavioral targeting of advertisements.</p>
      <p><strong>6. California Resident Rights</strong></p>
      <p>This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (or &ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;). If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the &ldquo;Exercising Your Rights&rdquo; section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at&nbsp;<u>info@beem.earth.</u></p>
      <p><strong>Access</strong></p>
      <p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>

      <p><strong>Deletion</strong></p>
      <p>You have the right to delete or request that we assist in deleting the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong></p>
      <p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information (e.g. login credentials to your account) to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a &ldquo;Valid Request.&rdquo; We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>
      <p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>
      <p>You may submit a Valid Request by emailing us at:&nbsp;<u>info@beem.earth</u>&nbsp;with the subject line &ldquo;CCPA Data Rights Request.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>You may also authorize an agent (an &ldquo;Authorized Agent&rdquo;) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>
