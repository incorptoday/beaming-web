      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        We take data protection and privacy very seriously at Beem. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your Personal Data. Below is an overview of the key points of our privacy policy and practices:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>We do not re-sell Personal Data.</li>
        <li>We take care to encrypt Private Sensitive Personal Data (defined below) like journal entries or reflections (only you have access to that content).</li>
        <li>Any App Analytics Data that we do collect – in the spirit of improving or personalizing the product, messaging, and content – is studied only at an aggregate level across the Beem community (e.g., which sessions are most popular), unless necessary for specific customer support or de-bugging.</li>
        <li>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide users’ Personal Data to any 3rd party data brokers.</li>
        <li>As is customary for web-based services, we partner with Service Providers (e.g., payment processors, database providers) to support our App and Analytics Partners to study how best to improve our App (e.g., which sessions are most popular). Personal Data shared with these providers is encrypted and protected both in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li>We do not share any Private Sensitive Personal Data with any Advertising Partners.</li>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect or solicit the data of individuals under the age of 13 without obtaining COPPA-compliant consent from a parent or guardian, and we do not knowingly share information about individuals under the age of 13 with Advertising Partners.</li>
        <li>You may, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, delete your full account and all data associated with it at any point.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At any time you may opt out of cookies and other tracking or exercise your other rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. Please read on to the Full Privacy Policy for more details.
